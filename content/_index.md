# Exam Preparation
# Cloud Foundry Certified Developer 

Welcome to the preparation class for version 2 of the Cloud Foundry Certified Developer examination. This class is designed to prepare existing Cloud Foundry users, or those who have taken Cloud Foundry Developer training, to pass the exam. *It is not a substitute for comprehensive Cloud Foundry training.*

## Overview

This prep course will include both instructor-led discussions and hands-on examples. Topics covered align with the [domains and competencies](https://training.linuxfoundation.org/certification/cloud-foundry-certified-developer-cfcd/#domains) for the exam. To ensure this prep course does not mirror elements of the exam too closely, we will take a *functional* look at the Cloud Foundry competencies that could be covered on the exam. 

## Preparation

Before you get started, download the [cfcd-prep.zip](/cfcd-prep.zip) archive, which contains apps used by throughout the prep course. Unzip this archive somewhere on your local filesystem.
