# Cloud Foundry Certified Developer Preparation

https://cfcd-prep.cloudfoundry.org

This class is designed to prepare existing Cloud Foundry users, or those who have taken Cloud Foundry Developer training, to pass the exam. *It is not a substitute for comprehensive Cloud Foundry training*.

Topics covered align with the domains and competencies for the exam. To ensure this prep course does not mirror elements of the exam too closely, we will take a functional look at the Cloud Foundry competencies that could be covered on the exam.
